To illustrate the application of the modelling technique and to examine the voltages produced in typical Ocean/Earth conductivity structures we present results for three models representing 1) a shallow sea, 2) a shallow ocean, and 3) a deep ocean.

* Shallow Sea
> This model consists of a shallow sea 600 km wide, with a depth of 100 m, with land at either end. The seawater section has the same properties as the continental shelf in table listed in [network modeling](netmodel.md). This is a simplified model approximation to the North Sea.
